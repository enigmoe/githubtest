#Chapter 5 (read with British accent in your mind)
Once upon a time there was a unicorn. It was so annoyed by the gnome. The gnome simply wanted to chop off its head, but the unicorn - which name was "Swoosh" by the way - did not comply with his plan. After vivid discussion between the two, Swoosh farted and flew away.

The END.
